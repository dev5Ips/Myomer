<div align='center'><b>INTRODUCTION</b></div>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now more than ever, people from all walks
of life are searching for meaning and purpose.
Some look for answers in meditation. Some look
in self-help books, therapy, religion, yoga, twelvestep
programs, and New Age philosophies.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people, however, are unaware that
the oldest -- and most time-tested -- answer was
given to us over 3300 years ago at Mount Sinai.
It is called: The Torah.</p>
<div align='center'></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Torah means instruction. The Torah and
its stories are, in essence, the story of our lives, a
spiritual blueprint that illuminates the intricate
layers and dimensions of our psyches and souls.
Every event in Torah reflects another aspect of
our inner personality. Through its mitzvot, or
commandments, the Torah teaches us how to
actualize ourselves according to G-d's intentions
in creating us. By deciphering the Torah code, we
disclose its personal message for us.</p>
<div align='center'></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>In the Torah's every word there is deep, personal and spiritual meaning.
</b>The process of receiving the Torah at Sinai
actually began 49 days prior to its being given
with the exodus from Egypt. These forty-nine
days are traditionally called <b>"Sefirat Ha"Omer,"</b>
which means the counting of the omer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Leviticus (the third book of the Torah)
23:15, the verse states, "You shall count...from
the day that you brought the omer as a wave
offering." The omer was a measure of barley
(approximately two quarts) that the Jews brought
as the <b>mincha</b> or afternoon offering on the
second day of Passover. This was followed by the
counting of the omer where the Jews counted
every day for seven weeks -- forty-nine days in
total --leading up to the festival of <b>Shavuot </b>on
the fiftieth day which also celebrates the
receiving of the Torah at Sinai.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even after the destructions of the First
and Second Temples where the omer offering was
brought, the tradition of counting the omer
continued. Beginning with the second night of
Passover, every one of these forty-nine days
binding Passover to Shavuot is counted in orderly
progression.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the evening prayer on each
of these forty-nine nights, a Jew recites a blessing
and then verbalizes the number of that day. In
addition to commemorating the counting of the
omer, the forty-nine days of sefirah also express a
Jew's eager anticipation of receiving the Torah on
Shavuot, fifty days after experiencing the
liberation of Passover.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>What is the significance </b>of counting for
forty-nine days and how does it relate to the
anticipation of and preparation for receiving the
Torah? What relevance does this counting have
for us today and how does this apply to the
exploration of the inner dimensions of our soul?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to these questions lies in a
deeper understanding of the exodus of the Jewish
nation from Egypt. The word <b>"mitzrayim"</b> (Egypt
in Hebrew) means limitations and boundaries,
and represents all forms of conformity and
definition that restrain, inhibit or hamper our
free movement and expression. Thus, leaving
Egypt means freedom from constraints. After
leaving Egypt, the Jews spent the next forty-nine
days in the desert preparing themselves
spiritually for the most monumental experience
of all time: the giving of the Torah to Moses and
the Jewish people at Mount Sinai.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This forty-nine day period was one
of intense character refinement. For forty-nine
days, the Jews climbed one step at a time up the
emotional ladder toward a higher purity. This
period of character refinement has just as much
relevance to our lives today as it did over 3,000
years ago. Just as we were slaves in Egypt, we can
also be slaves to our personalities, driven by
forces over which we often seem to have no
control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forty-nine days of sefirah teach us
how to regain control over our emotions,
showing us how to refine our characters, step by
step, in a way that is based on the eternal truths
of Torah.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the forty-nine-day period, we arrive
at the fiftieth day, <b>matan Torah (the giving of
the Torah), </b>having fully achieved inner renewal
by merit of having assessed and developed each
of our forty-nine attributes. What is the
significance of the fiftieth day of matan Torah?
On this day we celebrate the <b>Festival of
Shavuot.</b> After we have accomplished all we can
through our own initiative, then we are worthy
to receive a gift (matan) from Above which we
could not have achieved with our own limited
faculties. We receive the ability to reach and
touch the Divine; not only to be cultivated human
beings who have refined all of our personal
characteristics, but <b>divine</b> human beings who are
capable of expressing ourselves above and beyond
the definitions and limitations of our beings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The counting of sefirah that followed the
exodus from Egypt is a process that we must
continuously recreate in our lives in order to
achieve personal freedom.</p>

<div align='center'><b>THE EMOTIONAL ATTRIBUTES OF SEFIRAH</b></div>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hebrew word <b>"sefirah"</b> has several
meanings. The famous Kabbalist, the RaMak (R.
Moshe Kordevero, d. 1570), in his monumental
work the Pardes, writes that "sefirah" means both
<b>"mispar,"</b> meaning number and <b>"sipur,"</b> as in
telling a story. A third root of "sefirah" is <b>"sapir,"</b>
a sapphire stone, which is a translucent crystal
that shines brightly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counting sefirah illuminates the different
aspects of our emotional lives. The days of
sefirah tell us a story--the story of our souls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spectrum of human experience divides
into seven emotions and qualities, known in
plural as <b>sefirot.</b> Each of these seven qualities, in
turn, subdivides into seven, making a total of
forty-nine.</p>
<div align='center'></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each day in time has a life of its own. A day is a unique energy flow waiting to be tapped and channeled into the fiver of man's being.
Each of the forty-nine days of sefirah
illuminates one of the forty-nine emotions; each
day's energy consisting of examining and refining
its corresponding emotion. After perfecting and
purifying all forty-nine dimensions, we are fully
prepared for <b>matan Torah,</b> for now we are in
synch with the forty-nine Divine attributes from
which the human attributes evolve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is a description of the seven
emotional attributes, that in various combination
constitute the forty-nine qualities to be examined
and developed during this period. The following
offers only one of many applications.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forty-nine-day period of sefirah is
counted in days and weeks. The seven days of
each of the seven weeks constitutes the forty-nine
days. Each week is represented by a specific
attribute, and each day within that week is
represented by an aspect of that attribute. Since
a fully-functional emotion is multi-dimensional, it
includes within itself a blend of all seven
attributes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example: The first week of sefirah is
dedicated to <b>CHESED</b>--the attribute of loving
kindness. On Day One of Week One we deal with
<b>chesed she'b'chesed </b>--the aspect of loving kindness
in loving kindness. On Day Two of Week One we
focus on <b>gevurah she'b'chesed </b>-- the aspect of
restraint in loving kindness. On Day Three of
Week One, the focus is on <b>tiferet she'b'chesed </b>--
the harmony in loving-kindness, and so on for all
seven days of the week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This day by day analysis will give you the
ability to stand back and take an objective look at
your subjective emotions. Seeing their strong and
weak points will in turn enable you to apply
yourself to the development and perfection of
these feelings as you grow towards emotional and
spiritual maturity.</p>
