<p>BA-RUCH A-TAH ADO-NAI E-LO-HE-NU ME-LECH HA-OLAM ASHER KID-E-SHA-NU BE-MITZ-VO-TAV VETZI-VA-NU AL SEFI-RAT HA-OMER.</p>

<p>Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us concerning the counting of the Omer.</p>

<p><b>%%DYNAMIC1%%</b></p>

<p>May the Merciful One restore the Holy Temple to its place, speedily in our days; Amen. Selah.  
</p>
 
<p>For the Choirmaster; a song with instrumental
music; a Psalm. May G-d be gracious to us and
bless us; may He make His countenance shine
upon us forever; that Your way be known on
earth, Your salvation among all nations. The
nations will extol You, O G-d; all the nations will
extol You. The nations will rejoice and sing for
joy, for You will judge the peoples justly and
guide the nations on earth forever. The peoples
will extol You, O G-d; all the peoples will extol
You, for the earth will have yielded its produce
and G-d; our G-d, will bless us. G-d will bless us;
and all, from the farthest corners of the earth,
shall fear Him.
</p>

<p>We implore you, by the great power of Your right
hand, release the captive. Accept the prayer of
Your people; strengthen us, purify us, Awesome
One. Mighty One, we beseech You, guard as the
apple of the eye those who seek Your Oneness.
Bless them, cleanse them; bestow upon them
forever Your merciful righteousness. Powerful,
Holy One, in Your abounding goodness, guide
Your congregation. Only and Exalted One, turn to
Your people who are mindful of Your holiness.
Accept our supplication and hear our cry, You
who knows secret thoughts. Blessed be the name
of the glory of His kingdom forever and ever.  
</p>

<p>Master of the universe, You have
commanded us through Moses Your servant
to count Sefirat Ha-Omer, in order to purify
us from our evil and uncleanness. As You
have written in Your Torah, You shall count
for yourselves from the day following the
day of rest, from the day on which you bring
the Omer as a wave-offering; [the counting]
shall be for seven full weeks. Until the day
following the seventh week shall you count
fifty days, so that the souls of Your people
Israel may be cleansed from their defilement.
Therefore, may it be Your will, L-rd our G-d
and G-d of our fathers, that in the merit of
the Sefirat Ha-Omer which I counted today,
the blemish that I have caused in the sefirah
    <b>%%DYNAMIC2%%</b> be rectified
and I may be purified and sanctified with
supernal holiness. May abundant bounty
thereby be bestowed upon all the worlds.
May it rectify our nefesh, ruach and
neshamah from every baseness and defect,
and may it purify and sanctify us with Your
supernal holiness.
